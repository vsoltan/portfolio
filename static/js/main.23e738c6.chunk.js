I also wrote middleware to facilitate authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), authorization to give different users appropriate levels of access, and data validation to make sure that frontend requests were being properly formatted. Looking back, the first couple of weeks it seemed like I was drinking from a firehose, learning about Node, MongoDB, Web Tokens; among other things. As a direct result of this; however, I came away having a completely different understanding of the way that the internet works and a glimpse into how complex, data-driven applications are built.

A more technically rooted challenge was regarding the way we opted to store our data, which was in documents since we decided to use MongoDB. However, the design specification for our API was such that the frontend would receive the employee data already pre-constructed as a tree. But, since an addition, removal, or transfer of an employee could change the entire structure of the tree, the team had to find a way to minimize the number of flat list to tree conversions that we otherwise had to perform every time the frontend requested tree data. We tried storing the tree as a separate collection for each company but eventually realized that MongoDB is fairly limited when it comes to search queries on hierarchical structures. What we eventually decided on is to maintain a cache that is updated whenever the employee list is mutated. So any time the frontend requests employee data, we already have the most up-to-date flat and constructed lists that we can send over."}),Object(O.jsx)("p",{children:"There are a lot of other design decisions that I left out here for the sake of brevity, but I would like to conclude by saying that so far, this project is unique in the sheer number of moving parts that were involved and the communication that was required to make a cohesive, functional product.

While the parts were being delivered, we managed to set up a very basic Node.js server locally and mock the networking elements of the firmware by writing C code outside of the mbed environment.
