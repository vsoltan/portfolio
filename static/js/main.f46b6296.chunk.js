to participate in the specification, design, creation, and testing of a product on behalf of the company sponsor. As part of this cooperative/integrative experience, we were tasked with building a microservice that would fit into the broader ecosystem or suite of human resource software developed by UKG. More specifically, we were responsible for designing an interface that provides employees with a view of their company's structure and allows managers to make changes to it. Some features that we implemented include; adding, editing, transferring, and removing employees; uploading profile pictures for each employee; and searching the organization by a number of supported keywords."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Prior to this project, I had absolutely zero experience working with databases and backend technologies and when it came time to split into teams, I decided to take advantage of this learning opportunity and joined the backend team. As such, I worked on setting up a collection of endpoints to service the front end's requests to the database. I also wrote middleware to facilitate authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), authorization to give different users appropriate levels of access, and data validation to make sure that frontend requests were being properly formatted. Looking back, the first couple of weeks it seemed like I was drinking from a firehose, learning about Node, MongoDB, Web Tokens; among other things. As a direct result of this; however, I came away having a completely different understanding of the way that the internet works and a glimpse into how complex, data-driven applications are built. Furthermore, since I was a part of a 10 person team, this experience reinforced the importance of clear communication, comprehensive documentation, and extensive testing."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"For challenges, there were the usual but ever-present inaccuracies in time estimation and lapses in communication but also the fact that every member of the backend team was working with many of the technologies for the first time. A more technically rooted challenge was regarding the way we opted to store our data, which was in documents since we decided to use MongoDB. However, the design specification for our API was such that the frontend would receive the employee data already pre-constructed as a tree. But, since an addition, removal, or transfer of an employee could change the entire structure of the tree, the team had to find a way to minimize the number of flat list to tree conversions that we otherwise had to perform every time the frontend requested tree data. We tried storing the tree as a separate collection for each company but eventually realized that MongoDB is fairly limited when it comes to search queries on hierarchical structures. What we eventually decided on is to maintain a cache that is updated whenever the employee list is mutated. So any time the frontend requests employee data, we already have the most up-to-date flat and constructed lists that we can send over."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"There are a lot of other design decisions that I left out here for the sake of brevity, but I would like to conclude by saying that so far, this project is unique in the sheer number of moving parts that were involved and the communication that was required to make a cohesive, functional product.

But, we also did not have any relevant experience in networking and Node so we knew that we had to put in the work to figure out the fundamentals. While the parts were being delivered, we managed to set up a very basic Node.js server locally and mock the networking elements of the firmware by writing C code outside of the mbed environment.

Before the raytracer runs, we can construct a tree which, at every level, uses a bounding box to specify which geometry is contained in a particular area of the scene. Therefore, if a ray doesn't intersect a bounding box at some level in the tree, we can forego calculating intersections with the geometry contained within that bounding box."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The optimization gains were incredible.
